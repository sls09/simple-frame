# simple-frame
A simple 2D Frame Analysis Solver 
This program calculates the reaction forces and moments for a two legged 2D Frame Structure, and then plots the shear and moment diagrams for each member. 

Assumptions: 
- External Applied Loads are positive when pointing toward the member, and is negative when pointing away from the member. 
- Inputs P, w1, w2, l, and s
